# pLIN: Plasmid Life Identification Number System

A hierarchical, permanent, reference-free classification system for bacterial plasmid genomes integrated with antimicrobial resistance gene surveillance.

## Overview

**pLIN** (plasmid Life Identification Number) is the first application of the Life Identification Number (LIN) framework to plasmid genomes. It assigns each plasmid a six-position hierarchical code (A.B.C.D.E.F) based on tetranucleotide composition distances and single-linkage clustering at six biologically calibrated thresholds.

### Key Features

- **Hierarchical**: 6 nested levels from family (~85% ANI) to strain (~99.9% ANI)
- **Permanent**: Codes never change when new plasmids are added
- **Reference-free**: No external database required — works on raw nucleotide sequences
- **AMR-integrated**: Full integration with NCBI AMRFinderPlus for resistance gene surveillance
- **Inc Auto-Detection**: KNN classifier (96.1% accuracy) identifies Inc groups from k-mer composition
- **Mobility Prediction**: Classifies plasmids as conjugative, mobilizable, or non-mobilizable
- **Outbreak Detection**: Flags clonal clusters sharing identical pLIN codes and AMR profiles
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Per-Inc-group distance threshold calibration from training data
- **Multi-Linkage**: Selectable clustering methods (single, complete, average, weighted)
- **Interactive GUI**: Streamlit web app with 6 analysis tabs — no command line needed
- **ML-validated**: Nested cross-validation confirms compositional features predict Inc-group membership (F1=0.903)

## Dataset

- **6,346** complete plasmid genomes from NCBI RefSeq
- **3 Inc groups**: IncFII (n=4,581), IncN (n=1,064), IncX1 (n=701)
- **2,232** unique strain-level pLIN codes (Simpson's D = 0.979)

## pLIN Code Format

Each plasmid receives a six-position code: `A.B.C.D.E.F`

| Position | Level | Distance Threshold | ANI Equivalent |
|----------|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| A | Family | d ≤ 0.150 | ~85% |
| B | Subfamily | d ≤ 0.100 | ~90% |
| C | Cluster | d ≤ 0.050 | ~95% |
| D | Subcluster | d ≤ 0.020 | ~98% |
| E | Clone complex | d ≤ 0.010 | ~99% |
| F | Strain | d ≤ 0.001 | ~99.9% |

Example: pLIN `1.1.1.7.30.567` = Family 1, Subfamily 1, Cluster 1, Subcluster 7, Clone 30, Strain 567

## Advanced Features

### Inc Group Auto-Detection
A KNN classifier (k=5, cosine distance, distance-weighted) trained on 6,346 plasmids predicts Inc group membership from 4-mer composition with 96.1% cross-validation accuracy. No replicon gene BLAST required.

### Adaptive Thresholds
Calibrates pLIN distance thresholds per Inc group using quantile-based analysis of within-group distance distributions. Addresses the limitation that fixed thresholds may not optimally separate lineages across diverse Inc groups.

### Mobility Prediction
Scans AMRFinderPlus output for conjugation (tra/trb) and mobilization (mob) gene markers to classify each plasmid as:
- **Conjugative** — has transfer genes, can self-transfer (highest risk)
- **Mobilizable** — has mob genes, needs helper plasmid
- **Non-mobilizable** — no detectable transfer machinery

### Outbreak Detection
Automatically flags groups of plasmids sharing identical pLIN strain codes (F-level) AND the same AMR resistance profile, indicating potential clonal spread. Risk levels: HIGH (3+ shared AMR genes) / MODERATE (1-2).

### Multi-Linkage Clustering
Supports single (default), complete, average, and weighted linkage methods. Complete linkage produces tighter clusters and reduces the chaining artifact inherent to single linkage.

### Nucleotide Transformer LLM (Optional)
Optional integration with [InstaDeep's Nucleotide Transformer](https://github.com/instadeepai/nucleotide-transformer), a genomic foundation model pre-trained on DNA sequences. When enabled, the NT model provides an independent LLM-based prediction of Inc group and AMR drug classes alongside the traditional KNN classifier.

**How it works:**
1. Plasmid sequences are split into overlapping 5,000 bp chunks
2. Each chunk is embedded by the NT model (6-mer tokenization, transformer encoding)
3. Chunk embeddings are mean-pooled to produce a single vector per plasmid
4. Linear probes (trained on your data) predict Inc group and AMR classes

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install optional dependencies
pip install transformers torch

# Train probes from your labeled training data (one-time)
python train_nt_classifier.py --model 50m
```

Then enable "Use Nucleotide Transformer (LLM)" in the GUI. Model variants: 50M (fast), 100M, 250M, 500M parameters. CPU and GPU (CUDA/MPS) supported.

### Prodigal Gene Annotation (Optional)
Full ORF prediction using [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) in metagenomic mode. While AMRFinderPlus focuses on clinically relevant genes (AMR, stress, virulence), Prodigal annotates **all** open reading frames on the plasmid.

**Output includes:**
- **Total gene count** per plasmid
- **Coding density** (percentage of sequence in coding regions)
- **Average gene length** (amino acids)
- **Complete vs partial genes** (genes truncated at contig edges)
- **Full gene table** with coordinates, strand, and length

**Why use Prodigal?**
- Get a complete picture of plasmid gene content (not just AMR genes)
- Identify replication, partitioning, and other backbone genes
- Calculate coding density as a quality metric
- Compare gene counts across plasmid families

**Setup:**
```bash
conda install -c bioconda prodigal
```

Then enable "Run Prodigal annotation" in the GUI.

### Bacterial Buddy — AI Assistant (Optional)
An integrated AI chatbot powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) that can answer questions about your analysis results and plasmid biology in general. Runs completely locally — no API keys needed, no data leaves your machine.

**Features:**
- **Context-aware responses** — understands your analysis results and can answer specific questions
- **Streaming chat** — real-time responses for a smooth experience
- **Multiple models** — choose from llama3.2, mistral, mixtral, and more
- **Suggested questions** — get started quickly with pre-written prompts
- **Privacy-focused** — everything runs locally via Ollama

**Example questions:**
- "Summarize my analysis results"
- "Which plasmids should I be most concerned about?"
- "Explain the Inc groups detected in my samples"
- "What is the clinical significance of conjugative plasmids?"
- "How does pLIN classification work?"

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Install Ollama (https://ollama.ai)
# macOS/Linux:
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# 2. Pull a model (llama3.2 recommended for speed)
ollama pull llama3.2

# 3. Start Ollama server (if not auto-started)
ollama serve
```

Then open the "🦠 Bacterial Buddy" tab in the GUI.

## Plasmid Sequences

FASTA sequences (695 MB total) are not included in this repository due to size. All plasmid sequences were obtained from NCBI RefSeq and can be downloaded using the accession numbers listed in `output/pLIN_assignments.tsv`.
